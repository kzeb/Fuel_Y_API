# Fuel Y - API

API for fuel consumption app "Fuel Y".

Written using Node.js, MongoDB, Mongoose, Express and JSON Web Token for added security.

Front-end for this app written in React is also avaliable on my GitHub profile.

This API lacks .env file which should contain:
- MONGODB_URL
- JWT_KEY
- JWT_TTL
- PORT
